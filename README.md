# Forex-sim
A flask based foreign exchange Binary trade simulation.
Might port to tkinter for an executable GUI. Right now, that design is all over the place. 
But the generation seems to be pretty solid.
How the hell am I going to get flask to update the webpage using ajax? I am confused as it is now. But I'll pull through.

Dependencies:
- flask
- forex_python
- tkinter
- matplotlib
- chart js
